# Task-Four
- using MVVM architecure Pattern: 
cause you can test ViewModel and itâ€™s not coupled with the UIKit code, you can test it more easily in your unit tests without it affecting the UI code.
althought the ViewModel bind the data to the view which avoiding tight coupling problem in others architecture patterns so help in reusability.


- Design Patterns used: 
 * coordinator -> to control the flow of the app and avoid putting navigation logic directly into controllers.
 * Delegate ->  for the call back for passing values or methods from one call to another class.
 * Decorator -> to extend or alter the functionality of objects at runtime by wrapping them in an object
